Ok, so I was coding some stuff for naranai and I was thinking to myself that itÅfd be cool if I could automatically detect a few dominant colors in a picture and use it to make them searchable. To start off honestly, there aren't many people doing too many things with PHP and color detection in images. I found a spiffy little class that gets me half-way where I want to be. That's where the problem comes in! The color extract class gets me to a nice solid color, and it does rounding so I donÅft get back 500 results.

So I get the sweet hex back and now I want a relative hue. You know? Brown, red, penis. So I start trying to look around for a list of rough hues and the RGB values relative to them.  I didnÅft have much luck, but lucky for me, someone had already done the legwork. The only minor issue was that it was JavaScript. SO WHAT DID I DO?!

I FIXED IT UP! Oh, as I side note, there are some color names I don't necessarily agree with and I'll fix them up over time. If there are any that you don't agree with, fork it and fix them for me.
